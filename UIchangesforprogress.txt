## Frontend Implementation Guide

### Component 1: Journey Progress Indicator (Persistent UI)

**Purpose:** Always-visible indicator showing the player's overall progress and anchor status.

**Location:** Suggest placing in a collapsible sidebar, bottom status bar, or as an overlay accessible via a button.

**Design Requirements:**

1. **Journey Phase Display** - The primary "how am I doing" indicator
```
   Journey: Building Roots 🌱
```
   
   | Phase | Suggested Icon | Color | Description |
   |-------|----------------|-------|-------------|
   | wandering | 🧭 | Gray | "You're finding your way" |
   | finding_footing | 👣 | Light blue | "Something is beginning" |
   | building_roots | 🌱 | Green | "You're making progress" |
   | approaching_home | 🏠 | Gold | "Home is within reach" |
   | home | ✨ | Bright gold | "You could stay forever" |

2. **Anchor Status Display** - Three compact indicators for belonging/legacy/freedom

   **Option A: Minimal (icons + level indicator)**
```
   ❤️ ●●○○○○  Legacy 📜 ●○○○○○  Freedom 🦅 ●●●○○○
      emerging           none              growing
```
   
   **Option B: Compact bars**
```
   [Belonging ❤️ ] ██░░░░ emerging ↑
   [Legacy    📜 ] ░░░░░░ none     —
   [Freedom   🦅 ] ████░░ growing  ↓
```
   
   Level-to-segment mapping (6 segments for 6 levels):
   | Level | Filled Segments |
   |-------|-----------------|
   | none | 0 |
   | emerging | 1 |
   | growing | 2 |
   | strong | 3 |
   | arrived | 4 |
   | mastery | 5-6 (full, maybe glowing) |

3. **Trend Indicators**
   - `rising` → ↑ or green up arrow
   - `stable` → — or no indicator
   - `falling` → ↓ or red down arrow

4. **Dominant Anchor Highlight**
   - Subtly highlight or badge the dominant anchor
   - Could show: "Your path leans toward Freedom"

5. **"Can Stay" Indicator**
   - When `can_stay: true`, show a special indicator: "✨ You could make this home"
   - This is the key unlock moment - make it feel significant

**Interaction:**
- Tapping/hovering on an anchor could show a tooltip with its meaning:
  - Belonging: "Community, acceptance, found family"
  - Legacy: "Lasting impact, teaching, building"
  - Freedom: "Autonomy, self-determination, independence"

**Mobile Considerations:**
- Default to collapsed/minimal view
- Expandable on tap
- Journey phase always visible even when collapsed

### Component 2: Milestone Toast/Banner (Event-Driven)

**Purpose:** Celebrate when the player crosses an anchor level threshold.

**Trigger:** `progress_milestone` message received

**Design Requirements:**

1. **Appearance:** Non-intrusive toast or banner that appears after narrative text
   
2. **Duration:** 4-6 seconds, or until dismissed

3. **Visual Design:**
```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ❤️ BELONGING                                │
   │                                             │
   │ "You sense the first threads of             │
   │  connection forming."                       │
   │                                     [none → emerging] │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

4. **Anchor-Specific Theming:**
   | Anchor | Icon | Color Theme |
   |--------|------|-------------|
   | Belonging | ❤️ or 🤝 | Warm red/pink |
   | Legacy | 📜 or 🏛️ | Gold/amber |
   | Freedom | 🦅 or 🔓 | Blue/teal |

5. **Level Progression Visualization:**
   - Show the transition: `none → emerging`
   - Or a simple progress indicator filling up

6. **Animation:**
   - Slide in from bottom or fade in
   - Subtle glow or pulse effect
   - Don't block narrative text

7. **Sound (optional):**
   - Subtle chime or tone
   - Different pitch for higher levels

**Mobile:** 
- Bottom toast works well
- Swipe to dismiss

### Component 3: Historical Wisdom Card (Event-Driven)

**Purpose:** Reward and educate when player makes historically accurate choices.

**Trigger:** `historical_wisdom` message received

**Design Requirements:**

1. **Appearance:** Distinct from milestone - this is educational content
```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ 📜 HISTORICAL INSIGHT                       │
   │─────────────────────────────────────────────│
   │                                             │
   │ "In ancient Egypt, priests controlled vast  │
   │  wealth and knowledge. Approaching the      │
   │  temple before secular authorities showed   │
   │  understanding of where real power lay."    │
   │                                             │
   │                        [Tap to dismiss]     │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

2. **Visual Distinction from Milestones:**
   - Use a "scroll" or "book" aesthetic
   - Parchment/sepia tones
   - Different icon (📜, 🎓, 💡)

3. **Content Display:**
   - Show the `insight` text (the historical fact)
   - Optionally show `narrative_hook` as a subtitle or on hover
   - Consider a small "Learn more" link (future enhancement)

4. **Timing:**
   - Appears after narrative + milestone (if both occur)
   - Stays longer than milestone (6-8 seconds) since it's educational
   - Or requires tap to dismiss

5. **Collectible Feel (optional enhancement):**
   - "Wisdom Collected: 3/12 in this era"
   - Creates completionist motivation

**Mobile:**
- Modal or bottom sheet works well
- Tap anywhere to dismiss

### Component 4: Progress Summary on Game Resume

**Purpose:** When resuming a saved game, remind player where they stand.

**Trigger:** Game loaded from save

**Design:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ WELCOME BACK                                    │
│                                                 │
